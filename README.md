This is a study on consumers perception towards maggi in Patan Gujarat India
1. INTRODUCTION OF THE STUDY
 
1.1 Introduction
 
Consumer is the king in the market place. Consumers are those who purchases goods and services for their personal consumption. Consumers behave according to their taste and preference and sometimes according to the occasion. Consumer perception is different from consumer to consumer. It depends on the states, standard of living, the price of product and many more. .Food and Nutrition are most important for all the living species. To keep the body healthy and active every living being consumes food.
Nestle India Limited (NIL) introduced the Maggi brand to Indian consumers when it launched Maggi “2mins noodles”, an instant food product in 1982. At that time, Indian consumers were rather conservative in their food habits, preferring to eat traditional Indian dishes rather than canned or packaged food. In fact, NIL was trying to create an entirely new food category instant noodles in India. Initially, the company targeted working women on the premise that Maggi noodles were fast to cook and hence offered convenience. However, this approach failed as was evident from the fact that the sales of Maggi noodles were not picking up despite heavy media advertising. To get to the root of the problem, NIL conducted A research which revealed that it was children who liked the taste of Maggi noodles and who were the largest consumers of the product. After this, NIL shifted its focus from working women and targeted children and their mothers through its marketing. NIL's promotions positioned the noodles as a 'convenience product', for mothers and as a 'fun' product for children. The noodles’ tagline, “Fast to Cook Good to Eat” was also in keeping with this positioning. NIL aggressively promoted Maggi noodles through several schemes like distributing free samples, giving gifts on the return of empty packs, etc. NIL's advertising too played a great role in communicating the benefits of the product to target consumers.
Increase in the figure of working couples, exposure to wider area, changing consumers eating habits and preferences, rise in the younger population, augmentation of middle class have made the mothers and their children to accept 2 minute noodles which is found as a quick snack for children. Even though the competitors of maggi have entered into the market, maggi tried to dominate the market and retained its position.
In recent years, due to lifestyle pressure Indian people mostly prefer for an easy and fastidious way of cooking meal rather than spending too much time for cooking. Nowadays mostly people are so lazy of cooking food. Most of the time people want to prefer fast food like Maggi cup noodles, bhel and so on. Alteration of ready to eat food in the global industry, and hence there is also modification in our life style. And therefore in current scenario Indian markets has switch in consumption patterns over a decades.
 
1.2 Objectives Of study
 
1) To identify factors that influence consumers to purchase and consume Maggi noodles.
2) To Analyse the consumer perception towards Maggi noodles.
3) To Analyse the consumer perception towards price of Maggi noodles .
 
1.3 Research Methodology
 
Source of data:
For systematic research, information is required from different sources of data
Primary data:
Primary data may be described as those data that have been observed and recorded by the researchers for the first time to their knowledge. I have collected primary data through the questionnaire method, filled up by respondents.
Secondary data:
Secondary data means the data which are readily available from different sources. I have gathered these data from the website, books and past research papers and journals.
Statistical tool: 
1.  Chi square:
Chi square test is used with the help of applying SPSS software. In test I make certain hypothesis and by applying chi square-Test and check the hypothesis on the bases of choosing appropriate factor. So this way I try to analyze the data collected through survey.
2. Cross tabulation:
Cross tabulation is a statistical process that summarizes categorical data to create a contingency table. They are heavily used in survey research, business intelligence, engineering and scientific research. They provide a basic picture of the interrelation between two variables and can help find interactions between them.
Sampling methods type:
1. Simple random sampling: In a simple random sample, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Your sampling frame should include the whole population.
To conduct this type of sampling, you can use tools like random number generators or other techniques that are based entirely on chance.
2. Systematic sampling: Systematic sampling is similar to simple random sampling, but it is usually slightly easier to conduct. Every member of the population is listed with a number, but instead of randomly generating numbers, individuals are chosen at regular intervals.
3. Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subpopulations that may differ in important ways. It allows you draw more precise conclusions by ensuring that every subgroup is properly represented in the sample.
To use this sampling method, you divide the population into subgroups (called strata) based on the relevant characteristic (e.g., gender identity, age range, income bracket, job role).
4. Cluster sampling: Cluster sampling also involves dividing the population into subgroups, but each subgroup should have similar characteristics to the whole sample. Instead of sampling individuals from each subgroup, you randomly select entire subgroups.
If it is practically possible, you might include every individual from each sampled cluster. If the clusters themselves are large, you can also sample individuals from within each cluster using one of the techniques above. This is called multistage sampling.
This method is good for dealing with large and dispersed populations, but there is more risk of error in the sample, as there could be substantial differences between clusters. It’s difficult to guarantee that the sampled clusters are really representative of the whole population.
5. Convenience sampling: A convenience sample simply includes the individuals who happen to be most accessible to the researcher.
This is an easy and inexpensive way to gather initial data, but there is no way to tell if the sample is representative of the population, so it can’t produce generalizable results. Convenience samples are at risk for both sampling bias and selection bias.
6. Voluntary response sampling: Similar to a convenience sample, a voluntary response sample is mainly based on ease of access. Instead of the researcher choosing participants and directly contacting them, people volunteer themselves (e.g. by responding to a public online survey).
7. Purposive sampling: This type of sampling, also known as judgment sampling, involves the researcher using their expertise to select a sample that is most useful to the purposes of the research.
It is often used in qualitative research, where the researcher wants to gain detailed knowledge about a specific phenomenon rather than make statistical inferences, or where the population is very small and specific. An effective purposive sample must have clear criteria and rationale for inclusion. Always make sure to describe your inclusion and exclusion criteria and beware of observer bias affecting your arguments.
8. Snowball sampling: If the population is hard to access, snowball sampling can be used to recruit participants via other participants. The number of people you have access to “snowballs” as you get in contact with more people. The downside here is also representativeness, as you have no way of knowing how representative your sample is due to the reliance on participants recruiting others. This can lead to sampling bias.

2. INTRODUCTION TO THE ORGANISATION
 
2.1 Introduction to industry
 
The food industry is a vast and dynamic sector encompassing the production, processing, distribution, and consumption of food products. It plays a critical role in meeting the nutritional needs of people worldwide while also contributing significantly to the economy of many countries. Here's a brief introduction to various aspects of the food industry:
1. Primary Production: This involves the cultivation of crops, farming of livestock, and harvesting of seafood. Farmers and agricultural producers are responsible for growing and raising raw food materials.
2. Food Processing: Raw food materials undergo various processing techniques to transform them into consumable products. This stage involves activities such as cleaning, sorting, cutting, cooking, and packaging. Food processing aims to enhance food safety, shelf life, taste, and nutritional value.

2.4 Manufacturing Process
 
Maggi 2-minute noodles, manufactured by Nestlé, are a popular instant noodle product. While the exact manufacturing process is proprietary and not publicly disclosed by the company, I can provide a general overview of the typical steps involved in the production of instant noodles:
 
1. Ingredient Mixing: The process begins with mixing the raw ingredients. The primary ingredients for instant noodles typically include wheat flour, water, salt, and sometimes other additives such as starches, flavour enhancers, and colouring agents.
2. Kneading: The mixed dough is kneaded thoroughly to develop the gluten structure, which gives the noodles their texture and elasticity.
3. Sheeting: The dough is then passed through rollers to flatten it into thin sheets of dough.
4. Steaming: The thin sheets of dough are briefly steamed to partially cook them and to stabilize the structure of the noodles.
5. Cutting: The steamed dough sheets are then cut into the desired noodle shape. Maggi noodles, for example, are typically cut into long, thin strands.
6. Drying: The cut noodles are then dried to reduce their moisture content. This is usually done using a combination of hot air drying and frying. Drying the noodles removes moisture, which is crucial for extending their shelf life and ensuring that they cook quickly when prepared.
7. Packaging: Once dried, the noodles are packaged in individual portions, often in plastic packets along with seasoning sachets containing flavourings, spices, and sometimes dehydrated vegetables.
8. Quality Control: Throughout the manufacturing process, quality control measures are implemented to ensure that the noodles meet safety, quality, and consistency standards.
It's important to note that Nestlé, like other food manufacturing companies, may have proprietary variations and additional steps in their process to ensure the unique taste, texture, and quality of Maggi noodles. Additionally, Nestlé likely adheres to strict food safety and quality standards throughout the manufacturing process to ensure the safety of their products for consumers.
